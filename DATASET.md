# How to install datasets

We suggest putting all datasets under the same folder (say `$DATA`) to ease management and following the instructions below to organize datasets to avoid modifying the source code. The file structure looks like

```
$DATA/
|–– caltech101_Gen/
|–– OxfordPets_Gen/
|–– UCF-101_Gen/
```



Datasets list:
- [Caltech101](#caltech101)
- [ImageNet](#imagenet)
- [OxfordPets](#oxfordpets)
- [StanfordCars](#stanfordcars)
- [Food101](#food101)
- [SUN397](#sun397)
- [DTD](#dtd)
- [EuroSAT](#eurosat)
- [UCF101](#ucf101)


The instructions to prepare each dataset are detailed below. 


### Caltech101
- Create a folder as `$DATA`.
- Download `caltech101_Gen.tar` from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rnj8ZcwCRboJOcz7IJE-zoYDmVdhPMm_/view?usp=sharing and extract the file under `$DATA`.


The directory structure should look like
```
caltech101_Gen/
|–– image_data/
|–– split.json
```
